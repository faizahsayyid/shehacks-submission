			<h1>Shein </h1>
			<p> Famous for its notoriously cheap prices and trendy clothing items, Shein does not boast about ethically-produced eco-friendly products. Instead, there are no pieces of evidence that show meaningful action is taken to reduce and eliminate many of the hazardous chemicals used. Due to its lack of transparency, there is no evidence it ensures payment of a living wage in its supply chain. It audits some of its supply chain but does not specify what percentage. In addition it sources its final stage of production from countries with extreme risk of labour abuse. </p>
